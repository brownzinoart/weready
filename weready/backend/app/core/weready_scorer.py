"""
WeReady Score Calculation System
===============================
Calculates the comprehensive WeReady Score based on:
- Code Quality (25%): Hallucination detection, structure, best practices
- Business Model (25%): Revenue model, market validation, unit economics  
- Investment Readiness (25%): Metrics, scalability, fundability
- Design & Experience (25%): UX/UI quality, accessibility, conversion optimization

This is the core differentiator that no competitor has.
