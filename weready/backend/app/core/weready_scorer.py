"""
WeReady Score Calculation System
===============================
Calculates the comprehensive WeReady Score based on:
- Code Quality (40%): Hallucination detection, structure, best practices
- Business Model (30%): Revenue model, market validation, unit economics  
- Investment Readiness (30%): Metrics, scalability, fundability

This is the core differentiator that no competitor has.
